    "Implementing `Zettelkasten` workflow in reading, writing, note-taking, research method, creativity, brainstorming, idea generator, etc., using `Zotero` as a reference manager, and `Obsidian` as a note-taking app for references downloaded in Zotero. There is a whole religion around note-taking with concepts such as `Second Brain`, `Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)`, and Zettelkasten.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find that a bit too much but I enjoy the software, it saves everything in clean `.md` files in your file system (makes it future-proof, you can change software later on and still have all your notes) and supports wiki-style linking between notes. I use Zotero simply because it is the best reference manager I have found, it is also free and open source if you are into that.\n",
    "\n",
    "My workflow is such that I start by reading an article in my Zotero library, and make highlights and notes directly on the PDF in the app. I do this on the official app, phone, or computer. I then import these highlights and notes into obsidian for storage and further processing ([src](https://www.arslonga.email/how-to-connect-zotero-with-obsidian/))."

    "There are four parts to the zettelkasten method, and I summarize them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1- Capture\n",
    "    2- Organize\n",
    "    3- Connect\n",
    "    4- Emergence\n",
    "\n",
    "__Capture__\n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing is simple. There’s only one step\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Jot it down\n",
    "\n",
    "Unformed ideas and potentially useful knowledge and information float around us all day long. So by capturing the idea, you save it for a later time when you can sit down, think it through, and see how it fits with the rest of your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Organize__\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing is the second step of the zettelkasten method. It is when you take the time to analyze the things you captured. Many of those captures will need to be deleted, they seemed cool at the time, but now you see why they don’t work or why you don’t need them. By deleting these unneeded or useless work notes, notes about your favorite hobbies, including notes in class that you don’t need, you’ll keep your zettelkasten digital note-taking application lean. When you find things you want to keep, expand them, make them more concise, and rewrite the ideas until you’re happy with them. If a note contains many ideas, split them into individual notes. These are called atomic notes, where each note contains just one idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Connect__\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting your notes is a vital part of the zettelkasten system. It’s where you take all those atoms and start to build larger theories from them. Luhmann did this by writing ID codes on his index cards, but using Obsidian, it will be much quicker and easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every note you make should be linked to another note. Obsidian plugins can help you. For example, by finding orphaned notes with no links, you can add links to them and bring them back into your web of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Emergence__\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergence is the final stage of the zettelkasten system. It’s where you start to see new ideas emerge from the connections you have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unrelated ideas that you would have never put together may only have one note between them, so when you browse your notes and link on the links, you suddenly see the connection, and a new idea for a book or article starts to emerge."
