    "Before we dive into Obsidian, it’d be good to first lay out the foundations of a **Personal Knowledge Management System** and **Zettelkasten**. The inspiration for this section and a lot of the work on Zettelkasten is from *Niklas Luhmann*, an outstandingly productive sociologist who wrote 400 papers and 70 books. Zettelkasten means (literally) “slip box” (or library in this article). In his case, his Zettlekasten had around 90000 physical notes, which have been digitized. Nowadays, there are loads of tools available to make this process easier and more intuitive. Obsidian, specifically has a good introduction section on their website: [https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/)\n",
