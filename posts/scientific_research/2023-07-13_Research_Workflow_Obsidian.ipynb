    "### What is a Mind Map?\n",
    "\n",
    "A mind map is a visual representation of an idea that uses nodes/points and lines to connect ideas together. The mind map primarily uses text inside of a node/point connected by lines. You can use color, images, line style, line weight, symbols, and other things to visualize your idea.\n",

    "### Why should I use a Mind Map?\n",

    "![Text](images/mindmap_obsidian.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have many lists, a mind map adds an extra dimension to lists. For example, I started this article as that mind map pictured above. Sometimes I start articles as outlines. Obviously, writing an article on mind maps must start with a mind map. mind maps work best for me in two broad use cases:\n",

    "#### Generating Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "As I’ve already shown, you can develop the structure of a writing or other creative project with a mind map. I love mind maps for any sort of project work. When I am going to start a new project I almost always start with a mind map of ideas I have about what I know about the project and what I need to find out about the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also think mind maps are perfect for planning activities when they aren’t “linear”. For example, my annual planning I do as a mind map first where I write out what I know will happen in that year and then brainstorm things I want to do in the year. I then take what I generate in the mind map and can place it on the calendar.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organizing Information\n",
    "\n",
    "When I am learning something new — particularly through reading — I very often start with a mind map. I love the Blank Sheet Method from Farnam Street. If I am starting a book on a topic I’m actively trying to learn, I’ll use a version of this method for my learning sessions. Each starts with a mind map about what I know about the topic and then as I’m reading, watching videos, or consuming other educational content, I’ll add to my mind map in a different color.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Mind Maps in Obsidian\n",
    "\n",
    "There are really three ways to use mind maps in Obsidian.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1- Create a mind map directly in your vault with a dedicated Mind Map plugin. We’ll look at my two favorites below.\n",
    "    2- Create a mind map directly in your vault with the Excalidraw plugin.\n",
    "    3- Create a mind map with an external tool. Link to it and/or import it into your vault."
